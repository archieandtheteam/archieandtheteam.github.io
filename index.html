					<p>Ketchup is literally the worst sauce ever created, I would rather cover my food is piss and cum before putting ketchup on it. It is so goddam bad. It doesn't even taste like tomatoes so you get these people saying, "I don't like tomatoes but I do like tomatoes, weird isn't it” REALLY BITCH MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE THERE TASTE DOESN'T EVEN COME CLOSE HUH? And oh it is so goddam sweet it is like they put more sugar in it then a drug dealer cuts in his cheep ass cocaine. And if any food becomes better with ketchup is shit ass food like, is the pizza better with ketchup?, bitch you eating cardboard with salami.</p>
